Data Structures and Algorithms Lab, 3rd Sem
---------------------------------------------

These are my programs for DS Lab 3rd sem. Few programs are taken from sources
that I might not have mentioned as almost all the programs are created a day
before the date of submission. :D

There is also a quick and dirty python script 'generate.py' which will create
a decent HTML page which can be considered as file. It will read all files
with C extension and files with 'txt' extension as their output and generate
HTML based on that. I intent to make it better for future pursposes. Main aim
is to automatically compile and generate output based on input from various
streams.

Those looking forward to put in their own files, here's the disclaimer.
Programs may or may not be fit for your purpose. I claim no responsibility to
anything. None of the programs are tested well enough, and they may fail at
various instance of conditions. So beware your professor may pick up that
error and screw you up.
